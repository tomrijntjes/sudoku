# sudoku

Usage: 

1.install python3 and pyeda. 
2.go to command line
3.python3 run.py

Notes:

solver.py contains three different classes. Solver solves generic sudoku's, DiagonalSolver adds the rule that both diagonals must contain unique numbers.

Norvig.py is the code copied from Peter Norvigs excellent tutorial http://norvig.com/sudoku.html

All sudoku's in the .txt files originate from there too.

#warning

DiagonalSolver is broken
