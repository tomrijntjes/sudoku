Notes:

solver.py contains three different classes. Solver solves generic sudoku's, BoxlessSolver does the same but with the box constraint removed, DiagonalSolver adds the rule that both diagonals must contain unique numbers.

Norvig.py is the code copied from Peter Norvigs excellent tutorial http://norvig.com/sudoku.html

All sudoku's in the .txt files originate from there too.
